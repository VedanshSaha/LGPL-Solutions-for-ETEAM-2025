# ETEAM 2025 — Team India Solutions

This repository contains the written mathematical solutions prepared and presented by **Team India** for the **European Tournament of Enthusiastic Apprentice Mathematicians (ETEAM) 2025**, held in Lyon, France, in July 2025.

ETEAM is a research-style team competition in which participants work over several months on open-ended mathematical problems. The emphasis is placed on exploration, structural understanding, and partial progress rather than closed-form solutions or routine computation. Teams are evaluated on the depth of reasoning, clarity of exposition, and their ability to discuss and defend ideas before a jury of mathematicians.

## Repository Structure

Each file in this repository corresponds to one problem from the official ETEAM 2025 problem set. The solutions follow a consistent research-oriented structure:

- Formal restatement of the problem  
- Introduction of notation and modeling assumptions  
- Exploration of small or special cases  
- Identification of patterns, invariants, or constraints  
- Development of lemmas and partial results  
- Discussion of remaining open questions and further directions  

The contents reflect collaborative mathematical investigation rather than finalized textbook solutions.

## Problem Summaries

### **Problem 3 — Dropping Intervals**

This problem studies a probabilistic model in which intervals of fixed length are placed at random on a discretized circular structure. The primary goal is to understand how overlap counts, coverage distributions, and clustering behavior depend on parameters such as the number of intervals, interval length, and the size of the discretization.

Our solution formalizes the circle as a cyclic modular structure and analyzes the induced coverage function. Small parameter regimes are examined combinatorially to establish baseline behavior, while larger regimes are studied using probabilistic and asymptotic reasoning. Particular attention is paid to symmetry effects, transitions between sparse and dense coverage, and the emergence of local concentration phenomena.

### **Problem 4 — The Apprentice and the Witch**

This problem involves a constrained process with adversarial or optimization-based dynamics. The analysis focuses on identifying invariant quantities and monotonic behavior under the allowed operations.

We derive bounds on achievable configurations by constructing extremal strategies and isolating key constraints governing the system’s evolution. The solution emphasizes how local rules propagate globally and how strategic choices affect long-term outcomes.

### **Problem 6 — Integer Polygons**

This problem explores polygons whose vertices lie on integer lattice points, subject to constraints on quantities such as perimeter, area, or admissible transformations.

Our approach examines geometric and number-theoretic properties of lattice polygons, including lattice point enumeration, parity constraints, and classification of admissible configurations. Small cases are analyzed explicitly and used to motivate broader structural results and bounds.

### **Problem 7 — Strange Lifts**

This problem studies the behavior of combinatorial or geometric objects under lifting operations to higher-dimensional or more complex structures.

We analyze which invariants are preserved under such lifts and how local constraints scale. The solution combines constructive examples with symmetry arguments to characterize valid lifts and rule out impossible configurations.

### **Problem 8 — Wandering Bacteria**

This problem models movement governed by stochastic or rule-based dynamics in a constrained domain.

Our analysis formalizes the movement process, studies long-term behavior, and characterizes steady-state or limiting regimes. We investigate how qualitative behavior depends on transition rules and boundary conditions, focusing on structural properties rather than explicit formulas.

### **Problem 9 — A Game with Lights**

This problem considers a discrete game in which configurations evolve according to fixed toggling rules.

We analyze the state space using combinatorial and algebraic techniques, identifying invariants and reachable configurations. Linear algebra over finite structures and parity arguments are used to classify outcomes and determine solvability conditions.

---

### **Problem 10 — Play on Words**

This problem examines transformations on strings or sequences under specified rewriting rules.

Our solution focuses on reduction strategies, canonical forms, and constraints on achievable transformations. We analyze how local rules affect global structure and provide proofs of necessary conditions using constructive examples and counterexamples.

## Mathematical Themes

Common techniques and ideas across the problem set include:

- Modular and cyclic structures  
- Invariant-based reasoning  
- Probabilistic and asymptotic analysis  
- Combinatorial classification  
- Symmetry and extremal arguments  
- Reduction to simpler or canonical cases  

The solutions aim to balance rigor with exploration, in line with the research-oriented philosophy of ETEAM.

## About ETEAM

The European Tournament of Enthusiastic Apprentice Mathematicians is designed to simulate authentic mathematical research at the pre-university level. Problems are intentionally open-ended, and teams are assessed on originality, depth of understanding, clarity of exposition, and their ability to engage in mathematical discussion rather than on completeness alone.
